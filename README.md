# Groundwater Level Prediction 

This project uses machine learning models to predict groundwater levels based on historical data such as rainfall, irrigation, and usage patterns.

## Project Overview:
- Used machine learning algorithms like **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest**.
- Trained on data containing features like:
  - Total Rainfall
  - Recharge from Monsoon/Non-Monsoon
  - Domestic & Industrial Usage
  - Groundwater Availability
- Focused on **classifying** groundwater status into:  
  `Excess`, `Moderate`, or `Critical`.

## Libraries Used:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- scikit-learn
- Flask (for basic web UI)

## Features:
- Preprocessing of real-world groundwater data
- Visualization and correlation analysis
- Model training and evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, F1)
- Web-based interface for prediction using Flask

## ML Models Used:
- Logistic Regression (main)
- Random Forest (for comparison)

## Result:
- Achieved high classification accuracy
- Logistic Regression offered simplicity and speed
- Random Forest provided robust accuracy for complex patterns

## Note:
This project was implemented as part of a mini project for the **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning** course.
